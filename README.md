# Project Overview
# Description

In 2019, HIPPOC experienced a significant data breach when a former Amazon Web Services (AWS) employee exploited a vulnerability caused by a misconfigured firewall in a web application stored in AWS. This breach exposed the personal information of 100 million individuals. We selected this project to highlight how even a large financial institution like HIPPOC, despite being highly regulated under cybersecurity laws and regulations, can still fall victim to cyber attacks.

# Our Proposed Solution
Our solution involved a comprehensive analysis of the 2019 cyber incident, leveraging the AWS framework in alignment with the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF). This framework guided us through the five core functions: Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover. Each function addresses specific categories such as asset management, governance, and risk assessment, which are further divided into subcategories. This structured approach provided a roadmap to enhance HIPPOC’s cybersecurity posture. A fundamental step in our strategy was the implementation of continuous monitoring and quick incident response systems to detect and mitigate threats in real time.

# Approach to Our Solution
To address the vulnerability that allowed unauthorized access to sensitive information, we developed cybersecurity strategies based on the AWS framework, aligned with the NIST CSF. We analyzed the 2019 cyber incident to create a customized cybersecurity plan and strategies for HIPPOC, focusing on the five Core Functions (Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover) and their associated categories and subcategories. This approach helped us enhance HIPPOC’s security controls. We proposed implementing security measures such as continuous monitoring and incident response systems to ensure timely detection of anomalies and unauthorized access within the infrastructure.

*What Worked*

1. Adoption of the NIST CSF: Utilizing the NIST CSF provided a structured, comprehensive approach to addressing vulnerabilities. The standards ensured that we were on the right path. 

2. Continuous Monitoring: Implementing real-time monitoring mechanisms allowed immediate detection of anomalies and issues, preventing potential breaches and identifying areas needing further fortification.

3. Alignment with the AWS Framework: By aligning our strategies with the AWS framework, we effectively leveraged AWS’s robust security tools. Services such as IAM, GuardDuty, and CloudTrail proved invaluable in enhancing security measures.

*What Didn’t Work*

1. Resource Allocation: While AWS offers a wealth of services, optimizing them for HIPPOC’s specific needs required significant resources in terms of both time and financial budget. Some tools, although effective, were resource-intensive.

2. Data Migration Challenges: Backing up existing data during the transition to more secure systems posed challenges.

3. Incident Response/Recovery and Communications: These components required manual work and other non-AWS services, rather than relying solely on AWS services.

# Lessons Learned

Throughout this project, we learned the significance of proactive cybersecurity measures, especially for a large institution that handles vast amounts of sensitive data like HIPPOC. The 2019 cyber incident served as a stark reminder that even the largest and most established organizations are not immune to cyber threats. Our journey underscored the importance of security training, continuous monitoring, quick response mechanisms, and multi-layered cybersecurity.
